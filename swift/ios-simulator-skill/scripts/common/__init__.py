"""
Common utilities shared across iOS simulator scripts.

This module centralizes genuinely reused code patterns to eliminate duplication
while respecting Jackson's Law - no over-abstraction, only truly shared logic.

Organization:
- device_utils: Device detection, command building, coordinate transformation
- idb_utils: IDB-specific operations (accessibility tree, element manipulation)
- cache_utils: Progressive disclosure caching for large outputs
- screenshot_utils: Screenshot capture with file and inline modes

Importing this package has no side effects. Xcode 27 compatibility is a
dependency requirement, not something this package patches at runtime:
idb-companion 1.5.1+ resolves SimulatorKit under the Xcode 27 layout itself.
Run scripts/sim_health_check.sh if `idb ui` calls misbehave.

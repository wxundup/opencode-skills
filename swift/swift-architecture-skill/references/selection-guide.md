## UI Stack Nuance by Architecture

- **MVVM**: SwiftUI favors direct state binding; UIKit/mixed favors coordinator-driven navigation.
- **MVI**: SwiftUI uses store-bound views; UIKit maps events to intents and renders from store state.
- **TCA**: SwiftUI uses `StoreOf` in views; UIKit uses a controller render loop from `ViewStore`.
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain/data stay the same; only presentation adapters differ.
- **VIPER**: UIKit-native fit; SwiftUI usually uses an adapter plus `UIHostingController`.
- **Reactive**: SwiftUI keeps pipelines in observable models; UIKit keeps them in Presenter/ViewModel.
- **MVP**: UIKit-native fit; Presenter drives passive View via protocol commands; SwiftUI uses an observable adapter.
- **Coordinator**: Works with both stacks; UIKit uses `UINavigationController` wrapper; SwiftUI models navigation as value-type state bound to `NavigationStack`.

## Observation Model (`@Observable` vs `ObservableObject`)

The deployment target determines which observation mechanism to use. This affects SwiftUI wiring in every architecture:

| Factor | `@Observable` (iOS 17+) | `ObservableObject` (iOS 14–16) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Import | `import Observation` (or none — built-in) | `import Combine` |
| Property tracking | Fine-grained (per-property) | Coarse (any `@Published` change re-renders) |
| View ownership | `@State` | `@StateObject` |
| Binding access | `@Bindable` | `@ObservedObject` / `$property` |
| Combine interop | Manual (wrap with `Publisher`) | Native (`$property` is a publisher) |
| UIKit integration | Observe with `withObservationTracking` or use KVO bridge | Subscribe to `objectWillChange` or `@Published` publishers |
| TCA | Uses `@ObservableState` macro (built on Observation) | Older `ViewStore`-based API |

**When to use `@Observable`:**
- iOS 17+ deployment target
- SwiftUI-first features where fine-grained re-rendering matters
- New code without existing Combine subscriber chains

**When to keep `ObservableObject`:**
- iOS 16 or earlier deployment target
- Existing UIKit code subscribing to `@Published` properties via Combine
- Shared models that expose publishers to multiple consumers
- Gradual migration: keep `ObservableObject` on existing types, use `@Observable` on new types

## Quick Decision Flow

```text
1. Is the feature stream-heavy (search, live feeds, real-time updates)?
   YES -> Mark Reactive (references/reactive.md) as a stream concern. Continue to choose the owning presentation/layering pattern below unless the task is only about stream composition.
   NO  -> Continue

2. Is strict unidirectional data flow and state-machine modeling required?
   YES -> Is the app already TCA-based, or is adding TCA dependency acceptable?
          YES -> TCA (references/tca.md)
          NO  -> MVI (references/mvi.md)
   NO  -> Continue

3. Does the codebase need strict layer isolation with replaceable infrastructure?
   YES -> Clean Architecture (references/clean-architecture.md)
   NO  -> Continue

4. Is this a large UIKit codebase needing strict per-feature separation?
   YES -> VIPER (references/viper.md)
   NO  -> Continue

5. Is the primary goal decoupling navigation from screens (deep linking, reusable flows)?
   YES -> Mark Coordinator (references/coordinator.md) as the flow concern. If screens also need state/presentation guidance, pair it with MVVM, MVP, TCA, or MVI below.
   NO  -> Continue

6. Is UIKit the primary stack and a fully passive View with zero logic desired?
   YES -> MVP (references/mvp.md)
   NO  -> Continue

7. Default recommendation:
   -> MVVM (references/mvvm.md)
```

## Inference from User Constraints

Use these request signals:

### Signals pointing to MVVM
- "simple feature", "screen-level state", "standard iOS pattern"
- small/medium feature without strict state-machine needs

### Signals pointing to MVI
- "state machine", "deterministic transitions", "unidirectional"
- need to replay/serialize state transitions

### Signals pointing to TCA
- "composable", "TestStore", "pointfree", mentions of TCA
- existing TCA codebase or strong child-feature composition needs

### Signals pointing to Clean Architecture
- "layers", "use cases", "dependency rule", "hexagonal"
- stable module boundaries and replaceable infrastructure are priorities

### Signals pointing to VIPER
- "module", "router", "presenter", legacy UIKit codebase
- strict role separation in large UIKit modules

### Signals pointing to Reactive
- "streams", "Combine", "RxSwift", "real-time", "search"
- feature behavior is event-pipeline driven (typeahead, WebSocket, live feeds)

### Signals pointing to MVP
- "passive view", "presenter drives view", "UIKit without observable state"
- migrating from MVC with minimal framework changes
- team prefers explicit command-dispatch over state binding

### Signals pointing to Coordinator
- "navigation", "deep linking", "flow", "routing", "decouple navigation"
- multiple screens need to be reused across different flows
- view controllers or ViewModels currently contain push/present calls

## Validating User-Requested Architectures

When the user pre-selects an architecture, validate it before finalizing:

1. Check fit across:
   - UI stack (SwiftUI/UIKit/mixed)
   - minimum deployment target (determines `@Observable` vs `ObservableObject` wiring)
   - feature complexity and state model needs
   - effect orchestration requirements
   - team familiarity and dependency tolerance
   - alignment with existing codebase conventions
2. Decide whether the request is a `fit` or a `mismatch`.
3. Respond based on the result:
   - `fit`: proceed with requested architecture
   - `mismatch`: recommend closest-fit alternative and explain why

If the user insists on a mismatched choice, proceed with the requested architecture but include a risk-mitigation plan.

## Combining Architectures

Some projects use multiple patterns. Common valid combinations:

- **MVVM + Reactive**: MVVM structure with Combine/Rx pipelines inside ViewModels
- **Clean Architecture + MVVM**: Clean layers for domain/data, MVVM for presentation
- **Clean Architecture + TCA**: Clean layers for domain/data, TCA for feature presentation
- **VIPER + Reactive**: VIPER module structure with reactive Interactors
- **MVVM + Coordinator**: MVVM for screen-level state, Coordinator for navigation flows
- **MVP + Coordinator**: MVP for presentation logic, Coordinator for navigation and routing
- **Clean Architecture + MVP**: Clean layers for domain/data, MVP for presentation

Combination selection rules:
- Choose one **primary** pattern for the user's main boundary: feature state/presentation, domain layering, or navigation flow.
- Choose a **secondary** pattern only for a distinct concern such as navigation (`Coordinator`) or streams (`Reactive`).
- Read both playbooks when recommending a combination, then explicitly say which files/modules each pattern owns.
- Do not recommend multiple full presentation patterns for the same feature boundary unless the task is a migration between them.

When combining, clarify which pattern governs which layer and keep boundaries consistent.

## Recommendation Format

When recommending:

1. Name one pattern and provide a fit result (`fit` or `mismatch`).
2. Give 1-2 concise reasons grounded in user constraints.
3. Cite the reference file.
4. If `mismatch`, include the closest-fit alternative and one trade-off.
5. Apply the selected playbook to the user’s feature.

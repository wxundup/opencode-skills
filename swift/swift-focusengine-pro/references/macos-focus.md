# macOS Focus Management

macOS uses a **key view loop** model — focus moves between views via Tab/Shift-Tab in a loop defined by the responder chain. This is fundamentally different from tvOS (geometric/spatial) and iOS (focus groups activated by hardware keyboard).

## Core Concept: Key View Loop

Every `NSWindow` maintains a loop of focusable views. Tab advances forward, Shift-Tab goes backward.

```
┌─ TextField ──► Button ──► PopUpButton ──► TableView ──┐
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### NSView Focus APIs

```swift
class MyCustomView: NSView {
    // Required: Declare the view can accept focus
    override var acceptsFirstResponder: Bool { true }

    // Required for Tab key navigation
    override var canBecomeKeyView: Bool { true }

    // Called when view gains focus
    override func becomeFirstResponder() -> Bool {
        needsDisplay = true
        return super.becomeFirstResponder()
    }

    // Called when view loses focus
    override func resignFirstResponder() -> Bool {
        needsDisplay = true
        return super.resignFirstResponder()
    }
}
```

### Window First Responder

```swift
// Make a view focused
window.makeFirstResponder(myView)

// Check what's currently focused
if let focused = window.firstResponder as? NSView {
    print("Focused: \(focused)")
}

// Resign focus (focus goes to window itself)
window.makeFirstResponder(nil)
```

### Key View Loop Setup

**Interface Builder:** Connect `nextKeyView` outlets in sequence, with the last view pointing back to the first.

**Programmatic:**
```swift
textField.nextKeyView = button
button.nextKeyView = popUpButton
popUpButton.nextKeyView = textField  // Complete the loop
```

**Auto-recalculation:**
```swift
window.autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop = true  // System manages the loop
// System uses geometric position (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) to determine order
```

Common mistake: Setting `autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop = true` AND manually setting `nextKeyView`. The manual chain gets overwritten.

## SwiftUI Focus on macOS

### @FocusState

Works the same as iOS. On macOS, focus is always active (no hardware keyboard requirement like iOS).

```swift
enum Field: Hashable { case search, name, email }
@FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

VStack {
    TextField("Search", text: $search)
        .focused($focusedField, equals: .search)
    TextField("Name", text: $name)
        .focused($focusedField, equals: .name)
    TextField("Email", text: $email)
        .focused($focusedField, equals: .email)
}
.onAppear { focusedField = .search }  // Auto-focus on appear
```

Key difference from iOS: Setting `focusedField = nil` on macOS does NOT dismiss the keyboard (there's no virtual keyboard to dismiss). It moves focus to the window itself.

### .focusable() on macOS

Makes non-interactive views focusable for keyboard navigation:

```swift
CardView(item: item)
    .focusable()
    .onKeyPress(.return) {
        openItem(item)
        return .handled
    }
```

On macOS, `.focusable()` views participate in the Tab loop automatically.

### .focusable(interactions:) (macOS 14+)

```swift
.focusable(interactions: .edit)     // For text-editing-like views
.focusable(interactions: .activate) // For button-like views
```

On macOS, `.activate` responds to Tab without requiring a system toggle (unlike iOS which requires "Keyboard Navigation" to be enabled).

### defaultFocus(_:_:priority:) (macOS 13+)

```swift
@FocusState var selectedField: Field?

VStack { ... }
    .defaultFocus($selectedField, .search, priority: .userInitiated)
```

### .focusSection() (macOS 13+)

Groups focusable views for arrow key navigation within a section:

```swift
HStack {
    VStack {
        // Sidebar items
    }
    .focusSection()

    VStack {
        // Content items
    }
    .focusSection()
}
```

Arrow keys move within a section; Tab moves between sections. This is the macOS equivalent of how focus sections work on tvOS, but with keyboard-driven navigation instead of remote-driven.

## Focus Ring (Focus Indicator)

macOS draws a system focus ring (blue glow) around focused views. This is the macOS equivalent of tvOS's focus scale/highlight and iOS's halo effect.

### NSView Focus Ring

```swift
class MyView: NSView {
    // Control focus ring visibility
    override var focusRingType: NSFocusRingType {
        return .exterior  // .exterior (default), .interior, .none
    }

    // Customize focus ring shape (default: bounds)
    override var focusRingMaskBounds: NSRect {
        return bounds.insetBy(dx: 4, dy: 4)
    }

    override func drawFocusRingMask() {
        // Draw a rounded rect focus ring
        NSBezierPath(roundedRect: focusRingMaskBounds,
                     xRadius: 8, yRadius: 8).fill()
    }

    // When content that shapes the ring changes (e.g. an image swap that
    // AppKit can't detect), CALL noteFocusRingMaskChanged() — it is not an
    // override point. Resizes and needsDisplay are handled automatically.
    func imageDidChange() {
        noteFocusRingMaskChanged()
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI Focus Ring

```swift
// System focus ring (default on macOS)
TextField("Name", text: $name)
    .focusable()

// Suppress system focus ring
TextField("Name", text: $name)
    .focusable()
    .focusEffectDisabled()  // No ring drawn

// Custom focus indicator
@FocusState var isFocused: Bool

TextField("Name", text: $name)
    .focused($isFocused)
    .focusEffectDisabled()
    .overlay(
        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8)
            .stroke(isFocused ? .blue : .clear, lineWidth: 2)
    )
```

Common mistake: Disabling the focus ring without providing an alternative visual indicator. Users need to see what's focused.

### NSFocusRingPlacement

When drawing views that contain a focus ring:

```swift
// In draw(_:)
NSGraphicsContext.saveGraphicsState()
NSFocusRingPlacement.only.set()
path.fill()   // Only the focus ring is drawn, not the fill
NSGraphicsContext.restoreGraphicsState()
```

## focusedValue / focusedSceneValue (Menu Commands)

On macOS, `focusedValue` is critical for making menu bar commands respond to the currently focused content. This is the primary use case — menus enable/disable and change behavior based on what's focused.

### Menu Bar Integration

```swift
// Define the key
struct SelectedDocumentKey: FocusedValueKey {
    typealias Value = Document
}

extension FocusedValues {
    var selectedDocument: Document? {
        get { self[SelectedDocumentKey.self] }
        set { self[SelectedDocumentKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}

// Set from your view
DocumentView(document: document)
    .focusedValue(\.selectedDocument, document)

// Read in Commands
struct AppCommands: Commands {
    @FocusedValue(\.selectedDocument) var document

    var body: some Commands {
        CommandGroup(after: .pasteboard) {
            Button("Export PDF") { document?.exportPDF() }
                .disabled(document == nil)
                .keyboardShortcut("e", modifiers: [.command, .shift])
        }
    }
}
```

### Multi-Window with focusedSceneValue

macOS apps commonly have multiple windows. `focusedSceneValue` propagates from whichever window is key:

```swift
WindowGroup {
    EditorView()
        .focusedSceneValue(\.activeDocument, document)
}

// Menu commands automatically target the key window's document
@FocusedValue(\.activeDocument) var activeDocument
```

### @FocusedObject (macOS 12+)

Pass an entire ObservableObject through focus (the API requires `ObservableObject` — `@Observable` models don't work with `@FocusedObject`):

```swift
.focusedObject(editorModel)

// In Commands:
@FocusedObject var editor: EditorModel?
```

## NSTableView / NSOutlineView / NSCollectionView Focus

### Table View

```swift
// Keyboard navigation is enabled by default
// Arrow keys move selection, Tab moves to next key view
tableView.allowsEmptySelection = false  // Ensure something is always selected

// React to selection changes (which follow focus)
func tableViewSelectionDidChange(_ notification: Notification) {
    // Selection changed via keyboard or mouse
}
```

### Collection View

```swift
// macOS 10.13+: Keyboard focus navigation
collectionView.isSelectable = true
collectionView.allowsEmptySelection = false

// selectionIndexPaths tracks focused/selected items
```

### Type-to-Select

NSTableView and NSOutlineView support type-to-select by default — typing characters jumps to matching rows. This is separate from focus/selection.

```swift
// Disable if it conflicts with your search field
tableView.allowsTypeSelect = false
```

## NSResponder Chain and Focus

macOS focus is built on the NSResponder chain. Understanding this chain is essential for debugging focus issues.

### The Chain

```
NSView (your view) → NSView (superview) → ... → NSWindow → NSWindowController → NSApplication → NSApplication.delegate
```

When a key event occurs, it travels up the responder chain from the first responder (focused view). If no view handles it, the event reaches the application level.

### First Responder vs Key View

- **First responder** (`window.firstResponder`): The view that receives key events RIGHT NOW. Can be any NSResponder.
- **Key view** (`canBecomeKeyView == true`): A view that Tab navigation can focus. Subset of views where `acceptsFirstResponder == true`.

A view can be first responder (receives events) without being a key view (not reachable via Tab). Example: a custom drawing canvas that handles key events but isn't in the Tab loop.

### becomeFirstResponder vs makeFirstResponder

```swift
// DO NOT call directly — use window.makeFirstResponder instead
view.becomeFirstResponder()  // Only called by the system

// Correct way to set focus
window.makeFirstResponder(view)  // Returns Bool — false if view refuses
```

`window.makeFirstResponder(view)` calls `resignFirstResponder()` on the current first responder, then `becomeFirstResponder()` on the target. If either returns `false`, the focus change is cancelled.

### Preventing Focus Loss

```swift
override func resignFirstResponder() -> Bool {
    if hasUnsavedChanges {
        return false  // Refuse to lose focus — forces user to save first
    }
    return super.resignFirstResponder()
}
```

## Key Window vs Main Window

macOS distinguishes between the **key window** (receives key events, has focus ring) and the **main window** (the document window behind a panel).

```swift
// Key window — the one with active focus
NSApplication.shared.keyWindow

// Main window — the primary document window (may differ from key)
NSApplication.shared.mainWindow
```

When a panel (NSPanel) or popover is visible, it becomes the key window. The document window behind it becomes the main window. `focusedValue` reads from the key window's hierarchy.

### Panels and Focus

```swift
// NSPanel steals key window status
let panel = NSPanel(contentRect: rect, styleMask: [.titled, .closable],
                    backing: .buffered, defer: false)
panel.becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded = true  // Only steal focus if panel has focusable content

// Non-activating panel — does NOT steal focus from main window
panel.styleMask.insert(.nonactivatingPanel)
```

Use `becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded = true` for inspector panels that should only take focus when the user clicks a text field inside them.

## NSPopover, Sheets, and Modal Focus

### NSPopover

Popovers create their own focus scope. Tab loops within the popover.

```swift
let popover = NSPopover()
popover.behavior = .transient  // Closes when clicking outside

// Focus automatically moves to first focusable view in popover
// On close, focus returns to the view that presented the popover
```

Common mistake: Not setting an initial first responder in the popover content. The user has to Tab or click to focus anything.

```swift
// In popover content view controller
override func viewDidAppear() {
    super.viewDidAppear()
    view.window?.makeFirstResponder(searchField)  // Auto-focus search
}
```

### Sheets

Sheets create a modal focus scope — Tab cannot escape the sheet.

```swift
// SwiftUI
.sheet(isPresented: $showSettings) {
    SettingsView()
}
// Focus automatically scoped to sheet content
// Cmd+W or Esc closes sheet and restores focus to parent
```

### NSAlert Focus

NSAlert's default button gets initial focus. Custom accessory views need explicit first responder setup.

## NSToolbar and Focus

NSToolbar items are NOT in the key view loop by default. Users reach them via:
- Mouse click
- Keyboard shortcut (if defined)
- Full Keyboard Access: `Ctrl+F5` to move focus to toolbar, then arrow keys

### Making Toolbar Items Focusable

In SwiftUI:
```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .automatic) {
        TextField("Search", text: $search)
            // TextField is automatically focusable
    }
    ToolbarItem(placement: .automatic) {
        Button("Filter") { }
            // Button is focusable only with FKA enabled
    }
}
```

### NSSearchToolbarItem

The system search toolbar item handles focus automatically — Cmd+F focuses it, Esc returns focus to the content area.

```swift
let searchItem = NSSearchToolbarItem(itemIdentifier: .search)
searchItem.searchField.delegate = self
// Cmd+F → focus search, Esc → focus content
```

## Multi-Window and Multi-Screen Focus

### Window Activation and Focus

```swift
// Bring window to front and make it key (focused)
window.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)

// Make key without changing z-order
window.makeKey()

// Listen for focus changes
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: NSWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification,
    object: window, queue: .main
) { _ in
    // Window gained focus — update UI state
}

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: NSWindow.didResignKeyNotification,
    object: window, queue: .main
) { _ in
    // Window lost focus — dim selection, pause animations
}
```

### Focus Restoration Per Window

Each NSWindow maintains its own first responder. Switching between windows automatically restores the focused view in each window.

```swift
// Window A has TextField focused
// User clicks Window B (which has TableView focused)
// User clicks back to Window A — TextField regains focus automatically
```

This is automatic — no manual save/restore needed. However, if your window's content was rebuilt (e.g., SwiftUI re-rendering), the first responder may reset.

### External Display

macOS apps can span multiple screens. Focus follows the key window, not the screen.

- An NSWindow on an external display can be key (active focus)
- Moving a window between screens does NOT affect focus state
- Full-screen windows on different screens each maintain their own focus
- Mission Control / Spaces switching preserves per-window focus

## SwiftUI Settings Window

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup { ContentView() }
        Settings { SettingsView() }
    }
}
```

The Settings window (Cmd+,) has its own focus scope. `focusedValue` does NOT propagate from the Settings window to the main window's Commands — use direct bindings for settings.

## .onKeyPress and macOS

macOS 14+ supports `.onKeyPress` in SwiftUI:

```swift
ContentView()
    .focusable()
    .onKeyPress(.escape) {
        dismiss()
        return .handled
    }
    .onKeyPress(characters: .alphanumerics) { press in
        handleTypeAhead(press.characters)
        return .handled
    }
    .onKeyPress(phases: .down) { press in
        // Only fire on key down (not repeat or up)
        return .handled
    }
```

Key press routing follows the focus chain — unfocused views don't receive key events. On macOS, `.onKeyPress` also works with keyboard shortcuts that don't have a modifier key.

## Full Keyboard Access on macOS

When enabled in System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Navigation, ALL controls become focusable via Tab — not just text fields and lists.

```swift
// Check if Full Keyboard Access is on
NSApplication.shared.isFullKeyboardAccessEnabled

// Views can check at runtime
override var canBecomeKeyView: Bool {
    // Return true always, or only when FKA is enabled
    return NSApplication.shared.isFullKeyboardAccessEnabled || alwaysFocusable
}
```

Important: Even without Full Keyboard Access, users can Tab between text fields and lists. FKA adds buttons, checkboxes, sliders, pop-ups, etc.

## Mac Catalyst Focus

Mac Catalyst apps run iOS UIKit code on macOS. Focus behavior bridges both worlds:

### What Works Automatically
- `UIFocusSystem` is active (same as iPad with keyboard)
- `UIFocusHaloEffect` renders as macOS focus ring
- `focusGroupIdentifier` maps to Tab navigation groups
- Tab/Shift-Tab navigation works

### What's Different
- `canBecomeFocused` must return `true` for custom views
- macOS menu bar integration requires `UIMenuBuilder` or SwiftUI Commands
- Focus ring appearance follows macOS system settings, not iOS halo styling
- `UIFocusSystem.focusSystem(for:)` — check it exists before using, nil if focus is unavailable

### Common Catalyst Mistake
Forgetting that Mac Catalyst inherits iPad focus behavior. If your iPad app doesn't support keyboard focus (no `UIFocusHaloEffect`, no `allowsFocus` on collection views), your Mac Catalyst app won't support it either.

## macOS vs Other Platforms

| Feature | macOS | tvOS | iOS/iPadOS |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|
| Focus model | Key view loop | Geometric/spatial | Focus groups (keyboard) |
| Always active | Yes | Yes | No (keyboard required) |
| Tab behavior | Next key view | N/A | Next focus group |
| Arrow keys | Within controls | Directional focus | Within focus group |
| Focus indicator | Blue ring | Scale/highlight | Halo |
| Primary input | Mouse + keyboard | Siri Remote | Touch |
| focusedValue | Menu commands | N/A | Menu commands |
| .focusSection() | macOS 13+ | tvOS 15+ | Not available |
| @FocusState | macOS 12+ | tvOS 15+ | iOS 15+ |
| FKA toggle | System Settings | N/A | Settings > Accessibility |

## Common macOS Focus Mistakes

### 1. Not completing the key view loop
If the last view's `nextKeyView` doesn't point back to the first, Tab stops working after reaching the end.

### 2. Forgetting acceptsFirstResponder
Custom NSView subclasses return `false` by default. Without overriding to `true`, the view is invisible to Tab navigation.

### 3. Focus ring on custom-drawn views
If you draw content with custom insets or shapes, the default rectangular focus ring looks wrong. Override `drawFocusRingMask()` and `focusRingMaskBounds`.

### 4. Conflicting autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop with manual nextKeyView
Setting `autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop = true` overrides all manual `nextKeyView` connections. Pick one approach.

### 5. Assuming Full Keyboard Access is always on
Most users don't enable it. Your custom views that rely on Tab focus for non-text-field controls may not receive focus for most users. Always provide mouse/trackpad interaction as primary.

### 6. Not using focusedValue for menu commands
Menu bar items that don't use `focusedValue` can't respond to the current selection. The menu item stays enabled/disabled regardless of context.

### 7. SwiftUI focus ring doubling
Using `.focusable()` on a view that already has system focus support (like TextField) can cause double focus rings.

## Not Available on macOS (or Different)

| API / Concept | Why Not / Difference |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Geometric focus movement | macOS uses key view loop, not spatial geometry |
| Siri Remote / D-pad navigation | No remote input device |
| `.hoverEffect()` (visionOS-style) | macOS uses `NSTrackingArea` or `.onHover` for pointer tracking |
| Digital Crown | watchOS only |
| `UIFocusGuide` | UIKit concept — use `nextKeyView` chain in AppKit |
| `UIFocusHaloEffect` | iOS/Catalyst — macOS uses system focus ring |
| `preferredFocusEnvironments` | UIKit — macOS uses `initialFirstResponder` on NSWindow |
| `shouldUpdateFocus(in:)` | UIKit delegate — macOS uses `resignFirstResponder()` returning false |
| Parallax tilt effect | tvOS only |
| `remembersLastFocusedIndexPath` | UIKit collection/table view — NSTableView preserves selection natively |

### macOS-Only Focus APIs (Not on iOS/tvOS)

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `acceptsFirstResponder` | Whether NSView can receive focus at all |
| `canBecomeKeyView` | Whether NSView participates in Tab loop |
| `nextKeyView` / `previousKeyView` | Manual key view loop construction |
| `autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop` | Auto-calculate Tab order from geometry |
| `NSWindow.initialFirstResponder` | View that gets focus when window opens |
| `NSFocusRingType` | Control focus ring appearance per view |
| `drawFocusRingMask()` | Custom focus ring shape |
| `NSWindow.makeFirstResponder(_:)` | Programmatic focus — macOS equivalent of UIKit's `setNeedsFocusUpdate` |
| `becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded` (NSPanel) | Panels that don't steal focus unless needed |

## macOS 26 / macOS 27 notes

> Evidence: Apple documentation, release notes, and WWDC26 sessions (Aug 2026) — doc-sourced; macOS 27 items are beta and may change before GA.

- **macOS 26 (Tahoe):** no new focus/key-loop APIs. Liquid Glass (`NSGlassEffectView`, `.glass` bezel styles) changes how focused system controls *look* — custom focus-ring drawing tuned to pre-26 chrome should be re-checked visually.
- **macOS 27 (beta):** keyboard navigation now reaches the **menu bar and status items**; NSStatusItem gains an expanded-interface-session API (delegate callbacks for when custom status-item UI holds keyboard focus). New `NSTextSelectionManager` brings system text-selection behavior to custom views. WWDC26's AppKit session also recommends the long-standing `NSWindow.autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop` (not a new API — see Key View Loop Setup above) over manual `nextKeyView` chains. Nothing here changes the responder-chain fundamentals in this file.

## WWDC Sessions

| Session | Year | Key Content |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Modernize your AppKit app | WWDC26 | autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop, menu-bar/status-item keyboard navigation, NSTextSelectionManager |
| Direct and reflect focus in SwiftUI | WWDC21 | @FocusState, focusedValue on macOS |
| Focus on iPad keyboard navigation | WWDC21 | Focus groups and keyboard focus (informs Catalyst behavior) |

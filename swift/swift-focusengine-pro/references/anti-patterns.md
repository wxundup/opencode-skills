# Focus Anti-Patterns (All Platforms)

These are critical mistakes that break focus navigation. Flag any occurrence immediately. Patterns 1-17 are the original tvOS patterns. Patterns 18-24 are macOS-specific. Patterns 25-30 are production tvOS patterns discovered during large-scale media-app development.

**Evidence labels.** Rules based on the Apple API contract carry no label. Rules based on observed behavior carry a one-line label, e.g. `> Evidence: verified production behavior (tvOS 18, Apple TV 4K + HD, 2026)` — these can diverge from what the docs imply, which is exactly why they're recorded. Re-verify labeled rules on new OS releases before assuming they still hold.

## Blocking (must fix before ship)

### 1. Using `.disabled()` to toggle interactivity on tvOS

`.disabled(true)` removes the view from the focus chain entirely on tvOS. Focus jumps unpredictably to a distant view. This is the #1 cause of "focus jumpiness."

```swift
// BAD — view disappears from focus chain
Button("Watch") { ... }
    .disabled(isLoading)
```

**There is no perfect SwiftUI replacement.** The commonly recommended `.allowsHitTesting(false)` is **unreliable on tvOS** — production testing revealed it may map to `isUserInteractionEnabled = false` under the hood, which anti-pattern #8 warns against. Production codebases have documented this: `.disabled()` makes buttons non-focusable even when re-enabled, breaking diagonal navigation. But `.allowsHitTesting(false)` was inconclusive about keeping views focusable.

**Recommended approaches, depending on context:**

```swift
// OPTION A: allowsHitTesting — works for simple cases but verify on device
Button("Watch") { ... }
    .allowsHitTesting(!isLoading)
    .opacity(isLoading ? 0.5 : 1.0)
// ⚠️ May not keep view focusable in all contexts. Test on real Apple TV.

// OPTION B: Keep button active, gate the action (most reliable)
Button("Watch") {
    guard !isLoading else { return }
    play()
}
.opacity(isLoading ? 0.5 : 1.0)
// Button stays focusable always. Action is gated in the closure.

// OPTION C: For sidebars/lists — use .disabled() with dual @FocusState gating
// See anti-pattern #25 for the full pattern.
// .disabled() works SAFELY when it only constrains ENTRY from outside,
// with all items enabled once focus is inside the container.
```

UIKit equivalent: `UIButton.isEnabled = false` also makes the button unfocusable. The reference UIKit pattern never disables individual items — it gates the container's `isUserInteractionEnabled` instead (see layout-patterns.md, UIKit Sidebar section).

**For sidebar/list items with active selection state**, see anti-pattern #25 below — `.disabled()` on multiple items simultaneously is an even worse variant of this problem.

### 2. Missing `.focusSection()` on horizontal ScrollViews in vertical layouts

Without `.focusSection()`, swiping down from a horizontal row jumps focus diagonally to a misaligned item in the next row. The focus engine needs this to treat each row as a logical group.

```swift
// BAD
VStack {
    ScrollView(.horizontal) { HStack { /* row 1 */ } }
    ScrollView(.horizontal) { HStack { /* row 2 */ } }
}

// GOOD
VStack {
    ScrollView(.horizontal) { HStack { /* row 1 */ } }
        .focusSection()
    ScrollView(.horizontal) { HStack { /* row 2 */ } }
        .focusSection()
}
```

### 3. Adding `.focusable()` to Buttons or NavigationLinks

Buttons and NavigationLinks are already focusable. Adding `.focusable()` wraps them in a second focusable layer, causing double-focus artifacts.

```swift
// BAD
Button("Play") { ... }
    .focusable()

// GOOD
Button("Play") { ... }
```

Exception: `.focusable(isEnabled)` on a custom ButtonStyle's inner view is acceptable for conditional focusability.

### 4. Mixing SwiftUI and UIKit focus on same hierarchy

`@FocusState` and UIKit's focus engine (`setNeedsFocusUpdate`) are separate systems. When both are active on the same hierarchy (e.g., UIHostingController in UIKit), you get two "focused" items. Only the last-operated system's focus is real.

Rule: Pick one system per view hierarchy branch.

### 5. Calling `reloadData()` during animations

Animated data source changes cause the focus engine to lose track of the focused item. Focus jumps to the first item or an unexpected location.

```swift
// BAD
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3) { ... }
collectionView.reloadData()

// GOOD — gate focus updates
var allowsFocusUpdate = true

override func shouldUpdateFocus(in context: UIFocusUpdateContext) -> Bool {
    return allowsFocusUpdate
}

func safeReload() {
    allowsFocusUpdate = false
    collectionView.reloadData()
    collectionView.layoutIfNeeded()
    allowsFocusUpdate = true
    setNeedsFocusUpdate()
    updateFocusIfNeeded()
}
```

### 6. Using `frame.width` in focus transform calculations

Reading `frame.width` during layout changes causes jitter because the frame updates mid-animation. Cache the resting width.

```swift
// BAD
let scale: CGFloat = 1.13
let scaledWidth = frame.width * scale  // frame.width changes during layout!

// GOOD
private var restingWidth: CGFloat = 0
override func layoutSubviews() {
    super.layoutSubviews()
    if !isFocused { restingWidth = bounds.width }
}
// Use restingWidth in focus calculations
```

### 7. `setNeedsFocusUpdate()` called from wrong environment

`setNeedsFocusUpdate()` only works if the calling focus environment currently contains the focused view. If it doesn't, the call silently does nothing. This is the most common UIKit focus bug.

```swift
// BAD — calling from a VC that doesn't have focus
otherViewController.setNeedsFocusUpdate()

// GOOD — call from the VC that contains the currently focused view
// or from a common ancestor
self.setNeedsFocusUpdate()
self.updateFocusIfNeeded()
```

### 8. Setting `isUserInteractionEnabled = false` on headers/labels

On tvOS, `isUserInteractionEnabled = false` propagates to all descendants and can permanently break focus traversal through that part of the view hierarchy.

```swift
// BAD
sectionHeader.isUserInteractionEnabled = false

// GOOD — just don't make it focusable (it isn't by default)
// UILabel.canBecomeFocused is already false
```

### 9. `remembersLastFocusedIndexPath` + offscreen `reloadData()`

When `remembersLastFocusedIndexPath = true` and `reloadData()` is called while the collection view is NOT visible (e.g., behind a detail view), the remembered index path may not match what was previously focused.

Workaround: Combine with manual tracking via `indexPathForPreferredFocusedView(in:)`.

### 10. Using `UIView.animate` for CALayer properties

Shadow opacity, shadow radius, and other CALayer properties do not animate inside `UIView.animate` blocks. Use `CABasicAnimation`.

```swift
// BAD
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3) {
    self.layer.shadowOpacity = 1.0  // Does NOT animate
}

// GOOD
let anim = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "shadowOpacity")
anim.fromValue = layer.shadowOpacity
anim.toValue = 1.0
anim.duration = 0.3
layer.add(anim, forKey: "shadowOpacity")
layer.shadowOpacity = 1.0
```

## Warning (should fix)

### 11. Non-optional `@FocusState` with `focused(_:equals:)`

`@FocusState` MUST be Optional when using the `focused($binding, equals:)` overload. Non-optional only works with `focused($bool)`.

```swift
// BAD
@FocusState var field: Field  // Non-optional
TextField("Email", text: $email).focused($field, equals: .email)

// GOOD
@FocusState var field: Field?  // Optional
TextField("Email", text: $email).focused($field, equals: .email)
```

### 12. Missing `prepareForReuse()` cleanup for focus state

Reused UIKit cells retain focused visual state (scale, shadow, highlight) from previous use, causing visual jitter.

```swift
override func prepareForReuse() {
    super.prepareForReuse()
    transform = .identity
    layer.shadowOpacity = 0
    layer.zPosition = 0
    layer.removeAllAnimations()
}
```

### 13. `prefersDefaultFocus` inside ScrollView

`prefersDefaultFocus(_:in:)` does NOT work reliably inside `ScrollView` on tvOS. This is a documented Apple limitation.

Workaround: Use `@FocusState` + `defaultFocus(_:_:priority:)` or set focus programmatically after layout completes.

### 14. LazyVStack/LazyVGrid performance on Apple TV HD

`LazyVStack` and `LazyVGrid` inside `ScrollView` have severe lag on tvOS 18 (Apple TV HD). Consider using `List` or a custom List-based grid instead.

> Evidence: verified production behavior (tvOS 18, Apple TV HD, 2026) — not documented by Apple. Re-verify on tvOS 26+ and newer hardware.

### 15. `LazyVStack` deallocates offscreen rows — focus escapes to tab bar

This is the most dangerous `LazyVStack` issue on tvOS. When you scroll down, `LazyVStack` removes offscreen rows from the view hierarchy. When you swipe up quickly, the focus engine does a geometric search upward, finds no focusable views (they've been deallocated), and jumps straight to the tab bar — skipping all your content.

```swift
// BAD — rapid upward swipe escapes to tab bar
ScrollView(.vertical) {
    LazyVStack(spacing: 40) {
        ForEach(categories) { category in
            CategoryRow(category: category)  // Deallocated when offscreen!
        }
    }
}

// GOOD — VStack keeps all rows in hierarchy, LazyHStack stays lazy inside each row
ScrollView(.vertical) {
    VStack(spacing: 40) {
        ForEach(categories) { category in
            CategoryRow(category: category)  // Always in hierarchy
            // Inside each CategoryRow, LazyHStack is fine for heavyweight card content
        }
    }
    .focusSection()  // Also add this to prevent focus escaping to tab bar
}
```

This works when the outer row count is bounded (config-driven Home screen with ~4-10 rows). The row containers themselves are lightweight — the expensive content (images, thumbnails) stays lazy inside each row's `LazyHStack`.

For unbounded lists where `VStack` is too expensive, use `UICollectionView` with `remembersLastFocusedIndexPath` instead.

### 16. Missing `.focusSection()` on vertical ScrollView containing catalog

Anti-pattern #2 covers horizontal ScrollViews. Vertical ScrollViews also need `.focusSection()` to prevent focus from escaping upward to the tab bar or navigation bar.

```swift
// BAD — focus can escape to tab bar on rapid upward swipe
ScrollView(.vertical) {
    VStack { /* catalog rows */ }
}

// GOOD — focus contained within the catalog
ScrollView(.vertical) {
    VStack { /* catalog rows */ }
}
.focusSection()
```

Combine with `didUpdateFocus(in:with:)` on the hosting view controller to detect when focus does escape and trigger UI state changes (e.g., collapse fullscreen catalog back to normal):

```swift
override func didUpdateFocus(in context: UIFocusUpdateContext,
                             with coordinator: UIFocusAnimationCoordinator) {
    guard let tabBar = tabBarController?.tabBar else { return }
    let movedToTabBar = context.nextFocusedView?.isDescendant(of: tabBar) == true
    if movedToTabBar {
        handleTabBarFocused()  // Collapse catalog, restore default state
    }
}
```

### 17. Allocating objects inside `didUpdateFocus` or `shouldUpdateFocus`

Focus callbacks fire frequently during navigation. Allocating objects inside them causes per-frame garbage and can cause micro-stutters during fast scrolling.

```swift
// BAD — creates throwaway UIView on every focus update
override func didUpdateFocus(in context: UIFocusUpdateContext,
                             with coordinator: UIFocusAnimationCoordinator) {
    let movedToTabBar = context.nextFocusedView?
        .isDescendant(of: tabBarController?.tabBar ?? UIView()) == true  // UIView() allocated every time!
}

// GOOD — guard let, no allocation
override func didUpdateFocus(in context: UIFocusUpdateContext,
                             with coordinator: UIFocusAnimationCoordinator) {
    guard let tabBar = tabBarController?.tabBar else { return }
    let movedToTabBar = context.nextFocusedView?.isDescendant(of: tabBar) == true
}
```

Same rule applies to `shouldUpdateFocus(in:)` — no `String` formatting, no array creation, no object allocation.

## macOS-Specific Anti-Patterns

### 18. Not overriding `acceptsFirstResponder` on custom NSView

Custom NSView subclasses default to `acceptsFirstResponder = false`. The view silently ignores Tab navigation and `makeFirstResponder` calls. This is the #1 macOS focus bug.

```swift
// BAD — view never receives focus
class MyCustomView: NSView {
    // acceptsFirstResponder defaults to false
}

// GOOD
class MyCustomView: NSView {
    override var acceptsFirstResponder: Bool { true }
    override var canBecomeKeyView: Bool { true }
}
```

### 19. Incomplete key view loop

If the last view's `nextKeyView` doesn't loop back to the first view, Tab navigation stops working after reaching the end. Shift-Tab from the first view also fails.

```swift
// BAD — Tab reaches buttonC and stops
textField.nextKeyView = buttonA
buttonA.nextKeyView = buttonB
buttonB.nextKeyView = buttonC
// No loop back!

// GOOD — complete the loop
buttonC.nextKeyView = textField
```

Alternative: Set `window.autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop = true` and let the system manage the loop geometrically. But never mix manual `nextKeyView` with `autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop`.

### 20. Calling `becomeFirstResponder()` directly

Never call `becomeFirstResponder()` on a view directly. It's meant to be called by the system during `makeFirstResponder(_:)`.

```swift
// BAD — bypasses the resign/become handshake
myTextField.becomeFirstResponder()

// GOOD — proper focus handshake via window
view.window?.makeFirstResponder(myTextField)
```

Direct calls skip `resignFirstResponder()` on the current first responder, which can leave the previous view in a bad state (e.g., text editing still active).

### 21. NSPanel stealing focus from main window

Panels (inspectors, tool windows) default to becoming the key window, stealing focus from the document. Users lose their cursor position in text editors.

```swift
// BAD — inspector panel steals focus on every show
let panel = NSPanel(...)
panel.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)

// GOOD — panel only takes focus when user explicitly clicks inside it
panel.becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded = true
panel.orderFront(nil)  // Show without stealing focus
```

### 22. Not restoring focus after sheet dismissal

When an NSAlert or sheet is dismissed, focus should return to the view that was focused before the sheet appeared. SwiftUI handles this automatically, but AppKit requires manual tracking.

```swift
// BAD — focus goes to window, not original view
alert.runModal()

// GOOD — save and restore
let savedFirstResponder = window.firstResponder
alert.beginSheetModal(for: window) { _ in
    self.window.makeFirstResponder(savedFirstResponder)
}
```

### 23. Using `.focusable()` on NSViewRepresentable without bridging

Adding `.focusable()` to a SwiftUI view wrapping AppKit via `NSViewRepresentable` creates a SwiftUI focus layer that doesn't coordinate with AppKit's first responder. The AppKit view handles its own focus.

```swift
// BAD — double focus, SwiftUI ring + AppKit ring
struct MyAppKitView: NSViewRepresentable { ... }
MyAppKitView()
    .focusable()  // Don't add this

// GOOD — let AppKit handle focus natively
struct MyAppKitView: NSViewRepresentable {
    func makeNSView(context: Context) -> NSView {
        let view = MyNSView()
        // NSView handles its own acceptsFirstResponder
        return view
    }
}
```

### 24. Not disabling menu items when no document is focused

Menu items that depend on `focusedValue` but don't check for nil remain enabled when no window is key (e.g., all windows minimized), leading to crashes or no-ops.

```swift
// BAD — crashes when document is nil
Button("Save") { document!.save() }

// GOOD — disable when no focused document
Button("Save") { document?.save() }
    .disabled(document == nil)
```

## Production tvOS Anti-Patterns (added v1.5.0–v1.6.0)

> Evidence for #25–30: verified production behavior from large-scale tvOS media-app development (tvOS 17/18, Apple TV 4K + HD, 2026), each reproduced during fixes.

### 25. `.disabled()` on multiple list/sidebar items with active selection state

This is the most dangerous variant of anti-pattern #1. When you use `.disabled(!canFocus)` on MULTIPLE items in a list where `canFocus` depends on `activeTopicIndex`, ALL items simultaneously re-enter or leave the focus chain when the active index changes. This causes a "focus cascade" — the focus engine rapidly cycles through every item, creating visible flickering.

```swift
// BAD — mass-toggle: when activeSection changes, ALL rows simultaneously
// enter/leave the focus chain, causing rapid cascade
ForEach(Array(items.enumerated()), id: \.element.id) { index, item in
    Button(item.title) { select(index) }
        .disabled(activeSection != nil && activeSection != index)
}

// GOOD — use .disabled() only to GATE ENTRY from outside, not for
// within-list navigation. Combine with container-level @FocusState:
@FocusState private var isContainerFocused: Bool
@FocusState private var focusedIndex: Int?

ScrollView {
    ForEach(Array(items.enumerated()), id: \.element.id) { index, item in
        Button(item.title) { select(index) }
            .focused($focusedIndex, equals: index)
            .disabled(!isContainerFocused && selectedIndex != index)
            // When focus is INSIDE the sidebar, all items are enabled.
            // When focus is OUTSIDE, only the selected item is enabled,
            // so the focus engine can only land on the correct one.
    }
}
.focused($isContainerFocused)
```

This "dual `@FocusState`" pattern (container + per-item) was discovered in production tvOS development. The key insight: `.disabled()` gating works when it only constrains ENTRY from outside, not when it toggles during active navigation within the list.

### 26. `ScrollViewReader.scrollTo()` inside `onChange` creates feedback loops with focus engine

Imperative `scrollTo` repositions the viewport, which moves items under the focus cursor, triggering new focus calculations that fire `onChange` again, which calls `scrollTo` again — cascading.

```swift
// BAD — feedback loop: scrollTo → items move → focus changes → onChange → scrollTo
ScrollViewReader { proxy in
    ScrollView {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            Button(item.title) { }
                .focused($focusedItem, equals: item.id)
        }
    }
    .onChange(of: focusedItem) { _, newValue in
        withAnimation {
            proxy.scrollTo(newValue, anchor: .center)  // Disrupts focus!
        }
    }
}

// GOOD — declarative ScrollPosition (tvOS 18+, iOS 18+) doesn't fight the focus engine
@State private var scrollPosition = ScrollPosition(idType: String.self)

ScrollView {
    LazyVStack {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            Button(item.title) { }
                .focused($focusedItem, equals: item.id)
        }
    }
    .scrollTargetLayout()  // required for id-based ScrollPosition tracking
}
.scrollPosition($scrollPosition)
```

The declarative `ScrollPosition` approach lets SwiftUI coordinate scrolling and focus atomically, avoiding the imperative feedback loop. Id-based scrolling requires `.scrollTargetLayout()` on the layout container. On tvOS 16–17 deployment targets `ScrollPosition` is unavailable — use `ScrollViewReader` with animation disabled on programmatic scrolls during focus transitions.

### 27. `@Observable` same-value mutation triggers unnecessary body re-evaluation

With `@Observable`, property setters ALWAYS call `withMutation()` — even when the new value equals the old value. This fires observation notifications, causing SwiftUI to re-evaluate `body`, which can disrupt the focus engine mid-operation.

```swift
// BAD — always fires observation even when value unchanged
@Observable class TopicsViewModel {
    var displayedTopicIndex: Int = 0
    
    func topicFocused(index: Int) {
        displayedTopicIndex = index  // Fires even if index == displayedTopicIndex
    }
}

// GOOD — guard against same-value assignment
@Observable class TopicsViewModel {
    var displayedTopicIndex: Int = 0
    
    func topicFocused(index: Int) {
        guard displayedTopicIndex != index else { return }
        displayedTopicIndex = index
    }
}
```

This is especially critical in focus callbacks (`onChange(of: focusedItem)`) where rapid focus traversal can set the same value repeatedly, each time triggering a body re-evaluation that disrupts the focus engine.

### 28. `defaultFocus` with `.userInitiated` only fires on initial appearance

`.defaultFocus($focusedItem, firstItem, priority: .userInitiated)` only evaluates when the focus branch first appears — NOT on every re-entry. If focus leaves (e.g., to nav bar) and returns, `defaultFocus` does NOT redirect focus to the desired item.

> Evidence: verified production behavior (tvOS, 2026, reproduced in a standalone demo). Note the API docs read as if `.userInitiated` also covers "user-driven focus navigation" — observed tvOS behavior is initial-appearance only. An agent reasoning from the docs alone will get this wrong; trust the observed behavior and use the anti-pattern #25 gating pattern for re-entry.

```swift
// BAD — expects defaultFocus to redirect on every re-entry
VStack {
    SidebarView()
        .focusSection()
    GridView()
        .focusSection()
}
.defaultFocus($focusedSidebarIndex, selectedTopic, priority: .userInitiated)
// Works on first appear, does NOT work when returning from grid/nav

// GOOD — use dual @FocusState + .disabled() gating (see anti-pattern #25)
// or use container-level onChange to redirect:
.focused($isContainerFocused)
.onChange(of: isContainerFocused) { _, isFocused in
    if isFocused {
        focusedItem = selectedItem  // Redirect on every re-entry
    }
}
```

### 29. Transient focus bouncing during navigation transitions

When focus passes THROUGH a sidebar during grid→nav bar transitions (e.g., user presses up from grid, focus briefly enters sidebar, then continues to nav bar), the focus enters and exits the sidebar in rapid succession: `nil→10→nil→10→nil→10`. If sidebar state depends on focus (e.g., `onChange` triggers data loads or UI state changes), this causes visible flickering.

```swift
// BAD — every transient focus touch triggers state changes
.onChange(of: focusedSidebarIndex) { old, new in
    if let index = new {
        viewModel.topicFocused(index: index)  // Fires 3x during transition
    }
}

// GOOD — only trigger on "settled" focus (both old and new are non-nil = within-sidebar nav)
.onChange(of: focusedSidebarIndex) { old, new in
    guard let oldIndex = old, let newIndex = new else { return }
    // Both non-nil means focus is moving WITHIN the sidebar, not passing through
    viewModel.topicFocused(index: newIndex)
}
```

Alternatively, use a short debounce (`Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(100))`) to filter out transient focus touches. But the guard approach is simpler and more reliable.

### 30. Missing `preferredFocusEnvironments` on tvOS UIViewController with multiple focusable subviews

When a tvOS `UIViewController` (or its `view`) contains multiple sibling focusable subviews — a `UIStackView` of buttons, a row of `UIButton`s, multiple `UITableView`/`UICollectionView`s, etc. — and there is no `preferredFocusEnvironments` override, the focus engine picks the first focusable view it finds geometrically. That is rarely the intended initial focus.

This is an **absence-check finding**: the absence of an override on a screen that needs one is itself the issue. Flag it on PRs that add or modify a tvOS view controller with multiple focusable subviews, even when no focus API symbol appears in the diff.

```swift
// BAD — three buttons in a vertical stack, no override.
// First-launch focus lands on whichever button the engine finds first
// geometrically, not necessarily the primary CTA.
final class PaywallViewController: UIViewController {
    private let buttonStack = UIStackView()
    private lazy var subscribeButton = makeSubscribeButton()
    private let signInButton = UIButton(type: .system)
    private let dismissButton = UIButton(type: .system)
    // no preferredFocusEnvironments override
}

// GOOD — explicit primary CTA, conditional on visibility
final class PaywallViewController: UIViewController {
    override var preferredFocusEnvironments: [UIFocusEnvironment] {
        if showSubscribeOption {
            return [subscribeButton]
        }
        return [signInButton]
    }
}
```

How to spot in a diff:

- A new `UIViewController` (or a modified one) with a `UIStackView` / `UIView` arranging more than one of: `UIButton`, `UITableView`, `UICollectionView`, focusable custom view.
- The conditional shape of the screen changes (e.g. a new button appears under a flag) and there is no override or `setNeedsFocusUpdate` to redirect.
- A canonical reference codebase has the analogous screen with an explicit `preferredFocusEnvironments` override and the new code does not.

When the conditional changes after launch (a flag flips, content arrives async), pair the override with `setNeedsFocusUpdate()` + `updateFocusIfNeeded()` from the VC that contains the focused view. Do not call from a sibling/parent that does not currently contain focus — see anti-pattern #7.

Reference: `references/uikit-focus.md` "When to override `preferredFocusEnvironments`".

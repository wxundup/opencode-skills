# iOS/iPadOS Focus Management

iOS focus is a **secondary** interaction model alongside touch, driven by hardware keyboard (Tab and arrow keys). This is fundamentally different from tvOS where focus is the **primary** interaction.

## Key Difference: Two-Level Navigation

- **Tab key** moves between **focus groups** (significant UI regions)
- **Arrow keys** move *within* a focus group
- **Return** (iPadOS) or **Space** (Mac Catalyst) activates the focused item
- Focus only activates when a hardware keyboard is connected — your app must work without it

This two-level model does NOT exist on tvOS.

## iOS-Only APIs (Not Available on tvOS)

### focusGroupIdentifier (iOS 14+, NOT tvOS)

Assigns a view to a named focus group. Focus groups define what Tab navigates between.

```swift
// UIKit
sidebarContainer.focusGroupIdentifier = "com.myapp.sidebar"
contentContainer.focusGroupIdentifier = "com.myapp.content"
```

Rules:
- Set on the **common ancestor**, not individual focusable items
- UIKit automatically infers groups from the view hierarchy — only override when default grouping is wrong
- Elements with the same identifier belong to the same group
- Tab loop order is derived from focus groups, accounting for reading direction and layout

### UIFocusGroupPriority (iOS 15+, tvOS 15+)

Determines which item is "primary" within a focus group — the item that gets focus when Tab enters the group.

```swift
// Make this the preferred item when Tab enters the group
myButton.focusGroupPriority = .prioritized  // 2000
```

Priority levels:
- `.ignored` (0) — skipped for group primary selection
- `.previouslyFocused` (1000) — was previously focused in this group
- `.prioritized` (2000) — explicitly prioritized
- `.currentlyFocused` (NSIntegerMax) — currently focused

### UIFocusHaloEffect (iOS 15+, NOT tvOS)

System-standard focus ring (halo) for keyboard focus on iPadOS and Mac Catalyst.

```swift
class MyCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    override var focusEffect: UIFocusEffect? {
        // Custom rounded halo matching the image shape
        let halo = UIFocusHaloEffect(
            roundedRect: imageView.bounds,
            cornerRadius: 8,
            curve: .continuous
        )
        halo.referenceView = imageView   // Render above this view
        halo.containerView = contentView // Place halo in this view
        halo.position = .outside         // .inside, .outside, or .automatic
        return halo
    }
}
```

To disable the default halo:
```swift
override var focusEffect: UIFocusEffect? {
    return nil
}
```

Common mistake: Not matching halo shape to content shape (square halo on circular avatar).

### allowsFocus (UICollectionView/UITableView, iOS 15+)

Makes all cells keyboard-focusable.

```swift
collectionView.allowsFocus = true
collectionView.selectionFollowsFocus = true  // Auto-select on focus
```

Without `selectionFollowsFocus`, users must press Return after focusing a cell to select it.

## Shared APIs (iOS + tvOS)

### @FocusState (iOS 15+, tvOS 15+)

Same API, different context. On iOS, primarily used for:
- Keyboard focus management in forms (move between text fields)
- Dismissing keyboard (`focusedField = nil`)

```swift
enum Field: Hashable { case username, password }
@FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

VStack {
    TextField("Username", text: $username)
        .focused($focusedField, equals: .username)
    SecureField("Password", text: $password)
        .focused($focusedField, equals: .password)
    Button("Login") { focusedField = nil }  // Dismiss keyboard
}
.onSubmit { focusedField = .password }  // Tab to next field
```

### .focusSection() — NOT available on iOS

`.focusSection()` is **macOS 13+ and tvOS 15+ only**. It does not exist on iOS/iPadOS. To group keyboard focus on iOS, use UIKit `focusGroupIdentifier` (iOS 14+) on a hosting/container view, or restructure the layout — there is no SwiftUI focus-section equivalent on iOS.

### .focusable(interactions:) (iOS 17+)

Fine-grained control over focus interaction types:

```swift
.focusable(interactions: .edit)     // Text-like (sliders, steppers)
.focusable(interactions: .activate) // Button-like (needs Keyboard Navigation enabled)
```

`.activate` does NOT receive focus on click — requires system "Keyboard Navigation" toggle to be on.

### defaultFocus(_:_:priority:) (iOS 17+, tvOS 16+)

Modern cross-platform default focus API:

```swift
@FocusState var selectedField: Field?

VStack { ... }
    .defaultFocus($selectedField, .name, priority: .userInitiated)
```

### .focusEffectDisabled() (iOS 17+)

Suppresses the default system focus ring:
```swift
MyView()
    .focusable()
    .focusEffectDisabled()
```

### focusedValue / focusedSceneValue

Propagate data based on where focus is in the hierarchy. Used for menu/command systems:

```swift
.focusedValue(\.selectedItem, item)

// In Commands:
@FocusedValue(\.selectedItem) var selectedItem
```

`focusedSceneValue` for multi-window iPad apps.

### UIFocusItemDeferralMode (iOS 18+, tvOS 18+)

Controls whether focus deferral applies to an item during programmatic focus updates:

- `.automatic` — system decides (default)
- `.always` — always defer, even if deferral is off; a programmatic update to this item hides focus until the user interacts again
- `.never` — never defer; a programmatic focus update landing on this item always shows it focused

### UIFocusItemScrollableContainer (iOS 12+, tvOS 12+)

Protocol for custom scrollable containers. UIScrollView already conforms. Implement on custom containers so the focus system can auto-scroll to reveal focused items.

## iOS vs tvOS Quick Reference

| UIFocusHaloEffect | No | Yes (iOS 15+) |
| UIFocusGuide | tvOS 9+ | iOS 9+ (useful for keyboard focus from iOS 15) |
| @FocusState | tvOS 15+ | iOS 15+ |
| .focusSection() | tvOS 15+ | No (macOS 13+/tvOS only) |
| .focusable(interactions:) | No | iOS 17+ |

## Common iOS Focus Mistakes

### 1. Assuming focus works like tvOS
On iOS, focus groups constrain arrow key movement. Forgetting to set up proper groups leads to broken keyboard navigation.

### 2. Not testing without keyboard
The focus system only activates when a keyboard is connected. Your app must work perfectly with touch alone.

### 3. Overriding canBecomeFocused carelessly
This affects both regular Tab navigation AND Full Keyboard Access (accessibility). Test with both.

### 4. Modifier order in SwiftUI
`.focused()` must come AFTER `.focusable()`, not before:
```swift
// BAD
MyView().focused($field, equals: .name).focusable()

// GOOD
MyView().focusable().focused($field, equals: .name)
```

### 5. Ignoring selectionFollowsFocus
Without this on collection/table views, users must press Return after focusing a cell to select it — feels clunky.

### 6. Using focusGroupIdentifier on tvOS
It doesn't exist there. Use `.focusSection()` (SwiftUI) or `UIFocusGuide` (UIKit) on tvOS instead.

### 7. Not handling responder chain
On iOS, the focused item must be inside the first responder chain. Detached views cannot receive focus.

## focusedValue / focusedSceneValue (Deep Dive)

These propagate data up through the focus hierarchy, enabling menus and commands to react to what's currently focused. Critical for iPad multi-window apps.

### @FocusedValue — Single Values

Define a key and extend FocusedValues:

```swift
struct SelectedItemKey: FocusedValueKey {
    typealias Value = Item
}

extension FocusedValues {
    var selectedItem: Item? {
        get { self[SelectedItemKey.self] }
        set { self[SelectedItemKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}
```

Set the value from your view:
```swift
List(items, selection: $selectedItem) { item in
    ItemRow(item: item)
}
.focusedValue(\.selectedItem, selectedItem)
```

Read it in Commands:
```swift
struct MyCommands: Commands {
    @FocusedValue(\.selectedItem) var selectedItem
    
    var body: some Commands {
        CommandGroup(after: .pasteboard) {
            Button("Duplicate") { duplicate(selectedItem!) }
                .disabled(selectedItem == nil)  // Auto-disables when nothing focused
        }
    }
}
```

### @FocusedBinding — Two-Way Bindings

When commands need to modify the focused value, not just read it:

```swift
struct SelectedItemBindingKey: FocusedValueKey {
    typealias Value = Binding<Item?>
}

// In view:
.focusedValue(\.selectedItemBinding, $selectedItem)

// In commands:
@FocusedBinding(\.selectedItemBinding) var selectedItem
// Now selectedItem is a Binding — can write back
```

### @FocusedObject — Observable Objects

For passing observable objects through focus. Note: `@FocusedObject`/`focusedObject(_:)` **require `ObservableObject`** — an `@Observable` (Observation-framework) model does not work here, so don't "modernize" this pattern:

```swift
class DocumentModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var title: String = ""
    @Published var content: String = ""
}

// In view:
.focusedObject(documentModel)

// In commands:
@FocusedObject var document: DocumentModel?
```

### focusedSceneValue — Multi-Window iPad

`focusedValue` only propagates within a single view hierarchy. `focusedSceneValue` propagates across the entire scene, so menu commands know which window is active:

```swift
// In each window's content view:
.focusedSceneValue(\.activeDocument, document)

// In commands — reads from whichever scene is focused:
@FocusedValue(\.activeDocument) var activeDocument
```

**Known issue:** On UIKit-based platforms, `focusedSceneValue` can return nil with `DocumentGroup` even when a document is open. Works correctly on macOS. Workaround: use `focusedValue` with manual scene tracking.

### When to Use Which

| API | Scope | Use Case |
|-----|-------|----------|
| `focusedValue` | View hierarchy | Single-window apps, within-scene data |
| `focusedSceneValue` | Scene-wide | Multi-window iPad, menu commands |
| `@FocusedBinding` | View hierarchy | Commands that modify focused data |
| `@FocusedObject` | View hierarchy | Passing observable models to commands |

## Game Controller Focus

When a game controller (MFi, Xbox, PlayStation, etc.) is connected via Bluetooth, its directional pad drives the same `UIFocusSystem` as keyboard arrow keys.

> Evidence: Apple-documented — UIKit's "Focus-based navigation" collection (which spans iPad and tvOS focus) states apps are navigable "using a remote, game controller, or keyboard," and the HIG's Game Controllers page prescribes d-pad/left-stick focus movement. Specific button mappings below are HIG-derived; verify exact mappings on hardware before citing them in a review finding.

### How It Works

- D-pad directions trigger focus movement events
- A/X button acts as select (equivalent to Return key)
- The focus engine handles routing — no GameController framework code needed for basic navigation
- `shouldUpdateFocus(in:)` and `didUpdateFocus(in:with:)` fire normally

### Enabling Controller Support

UIKit apps automatically support game controller focus navigation. For SwiftUI, ensure views are properly focusable:

```swift
// These respond to controller d-pad automatically
Button("Play") { }
NavigationLink("Settings") { SettingsView() }

// Custom views need .focusable()
CardView()
    .focusable()
```

### Controller + Keyboard Coexistence

Both can be connected simultaneously. The focus system handles input from whichever device the user interacts with — no conflict resolution needed.

### GCController Notifications

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: .GCControllerDidConnect,
    object: nil, queue: .main
) { notification in
    // Controller connected — focus system activates automatically
    // Optionally show focus-friendly UI hints
}
```

## Stage Manager / Multi-Window Focus

iPad Stage Manager (iPadOS 16+) allows multiple windows side by side. Focus implications:

### Window Activation

- Tapping a window makes it the key window and activates its focus system
- Only the key window's focus system is active at a time
- Switching windows does NOT preserve focus position in the previous window by default

### Focus Across Scenes

Each `WindowGroup` scene has its own focus state. Use `focusedSceneValue` to let menu commands target the active scene:

```swift
WindowGroup {
    ContentView()
        .focusedSceneValue(\.activeEditor, editorModel)
}
```

### External Display

When mirroring or extending to external display:
- Focus system follows the key window, not the display
- External display content can be focused if it's in the key window's hierarchy
- Separate `UIScreen` windows need their own focus management

## .onKeyPress and Focus

`.onKeyPress` (iOS 17+) only fires on the currently focused view or its ancestors. If no view has focus, key presses are not delivered.

```swift
TextField("Search", text: $query)
    .focused($isSearchFocused)
    .onKeyPress(.escape) {
        isSearchFocused = false  // Dismiss keyboard
        return .handled
    }
    .onKeyPress(characters: .alphanumerics) { press in
        // Only fires when this TextField has focus
        return .ignored  // Let the TextField handle it normally
    }
```

### Key Press Routing Order
1. Focused view's `.onKeyPress` handlers (most specific)
2. Parent views' `.onKeyPress` handlers (bubbles up)
3. Key commands / keyboard shortcuts
4. System shortcuts

## Pointer Hover Effects on iPad

iPad trackpad/mouse pointer effects are separate from keyboard focus but related:

```swift
// Hover effect (pointer/trackpad) — NOT keyboard focus
Button("Tap me") { }
    .hoverEffect(.lift)      // Lifts when pointer hovers
    .hoverEffect(.highlight) // Highlights when pointer hovers

// These are independent — a button can have:
// - Pointer hover highlight (trackpad nearby)
// - Keyboard focus ring (Tab navigated to it)
// - Both simultaneously
```

`.hoverEffect()` on iOS responds to trackpad/mouse only (not touch). This is different from visionOS where `.hoverEffect()` responds to gaze.

## VoiceOver Focus vs UI Focus

These are **completely separate systems**:
- **UI Focus** (`UIFocusSystem`): Keyboard-driven, only active with hardware keyboard
- **VoiceOver Focus** (`UIAccessibilityFocus`): Assistive technology, `isAccessibilityElement` + `accessibilityElements` ordering
- **Full Keyboard Access**: Uses the SAME focus system as Tab navigation, so `canBecomeFocused` affects both
- SwiftUI: `@AccessibilityFocusState` controls VoiceOver focus independently of `@FocusState`
